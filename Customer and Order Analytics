#In this SQL snippet, I'm querying a database containing multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for a Macbook Pro Laptop?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'Macbook Pro Laptop'
AND orderid <> '' 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON customers.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the most expensive one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
SUM(Quantity),
Product, 
SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), 
avg(Quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON Feb.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
